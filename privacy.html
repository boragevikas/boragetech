    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 08, 2026</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Divvy</strong>, a mobile application developed by <strong>BorageTech</strong> ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner.</p>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>To provide you with the full functionality of Divvy (such as expense splitting, group management, and settlement reminders), we collect the following types of information:</p>

    <h3>A. Personal Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Phone Number:</strong> Required to create your unique user identity and allow friends to add you to groups.</li>
        <li><strong>Name:</strong> Used to display your identity to other group members.</li>
        <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> Used for account authentication, recovery, and support communication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Financial & Transaction Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Expense Details:</strong> We store data about the expenses you add (e.g., description, amount, date, currency) to calculate splits and balances.</li>
        <li><strong>Settlement Information:</strong> We track who owes whom to provide accurate debt simplification.</li>
        <li><strong>Note:</strong> We do <strong>NOT</strong> store your bank account numbers, UPI PINs, or credit card details. All actual payments are handled externally via third-party apps (e.g., WhatsApp, UPI apps).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Device & Usage Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contacts (Optional):</strong> With your explicit permission, we access your contacts to help you easily add friends to groups. We do not upload your entire contact list to our servers; we only process the contacts you select.</li>
        <li><strong>App Performance:</strong> We may collect anonymous crash reports and performance logs (via Google Firebase) to improve App stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected data for the following specific purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Core Functionality:</strong> To calculate debts, manage groups, and synchronize data across your devices.</li>
        <li><strong>User Authentication:</strong> To verify your identity and secure your account.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> To send you important updates regarding your account or support responses.</li>
        <li><strong>Improvements:</strong> To analyze usage patterns and fix bugs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored securely using <strong>Google Firebase</strong> (a Google Cloud Platform service). We implement industry-standard security measures, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Data is encrypted in transit (using HTTPS/SSL) and at rest.</li>
        <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Strict access controls ensure that only authorized systems can process your data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may share strictly necessary data with the following third-party services to operate the App:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> For authentication, database hosting, and analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>WhatsApp (User Initiated):</strong> If you use the "Send Reminder" feature, the App will open WhatsApp on your device with a pre-filled message. We do not access your WhatsApp messages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request a copy of the data we hold about you.</li>
